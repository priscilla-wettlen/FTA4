Postmodernism rejects
the idea of originality,
as it claims that everything
is a copy of a copy of a copy.
This statement is exemplified
by artists like Andy Warhol
and Marcel Duchamp. Warhol’s
silkscreen technique allowed him
to create his famous prints of
celebrities like Marilyn Monroe
and other elements of popular
culture, such as the
Campbell’s Soup
can and make an infinite number
of reproductions of them.
The point Warhol was trying to
make was very simple: by reproducing
an image so many times, its meaning
along with its value are lost.
The same principle applies to
Duchamp’s readymades.
